Here is a video demo of the keyboard

This is a home made custom mechanical keyboard. Here are the important points to note
1. Fully home made (including circuit board, excluding switches and keycaps obviously)
2. Circuit board has tin mask and solder mask; designed with old Adobe Photoshop!
3. Hot Swappable
4. TKL Split (90 switches)
5. Rotary encoder
6. Slider Potentiometer (code support coming up)
7. OLED display that shows WPM amd bongo cat gif while typing!
8. Python powered (KMK firmware, CircuitPython)
9. WebSockets / Bluetooth support to connect keyboard with anything (code support coming up)
10. Sandwich type acrylic laser cut case

Here are the switches and keycaps I bought and used for my build (procured through Indian distributors)
* [Akko V3 Creamy Purple Pro](https://en.akkogear.com/product/akko-v3-creamy-purple-pro-switch/)
* [Veekos Forest Gradient Keycap Set](https://www.veekos.com/product/veekos-forest-gradient-keycap-set-135-key/)

Checkout the README files within [/hardware](./hardware/) and [/software](./software/) to know how to build and use one yourself.

But do note that serious hardwork is required as this is a chill non-professional work done with a lot of homebrew / make-shift tools and stuff.

Thanks to @vu2ow for helping out with the build!
